# Overview

The **Wireless & Mobile Communication (WMC) Virtual Lab** is an interactive educational platform developed to digitize practical experiments for the Wireless & Mobile Communication laboratory.

Instead of relying entirely on physical laboratory equipment, the platform allows students to perform selected experiments directly from their computer using real hardware interfaces such as Wi-Fi adapters and Bluetooth devices, combined with software-based simulations and analytical tools.

The project consists of a modern React frontend and a FastAPI backend that communicate through REST APIs to perform real-time measurements, signal analysis, and visualization.

The application covers **Experiments 4 to 9** of the Wireless & Mobile Communication practical curriculum.
